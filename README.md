# Rover Project

This project was developed as part of the course *Project Workshop 1* of the Computer Engineering degree at the National University of La Plata. Its main goal is to integrate the concepts learned throughout the program into a functional autonomous rover system.

## Overview

The autonomous rover is designed to navigate and interact with its environment while providing real-time feedback to users. The system integrates hardware and software components to allow for precise control, communication, and monitoring.

### Key Features

- **Motor Control:** Smooth and precise speed and direction management.
- **Communication:** ESP32 and CIAA microcontrollers coordinate rover actions and receive commands from a backend system.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Video streaming from the rover to a web interface for live monitoring.
- **Web Interface:** Interactive dashboard with joystick control and task management.
- **Hardware Design:** Custom PCB, chassis design, and robust connectivity for motors, sensors, and peripherals.
